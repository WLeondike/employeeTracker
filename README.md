# Employee Tracker

  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this application, I will architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. Upon executing ``` node index.js``` inside the terminal, the user will then be prompted with options to add, update, or view their employees and what their roles are.
